## MUST have a Passport or Birth Certificate (this can be a certified copy or original)
- If using Birth Certificate, you need a photo ID along with it (I think we all have a learners or driver’s license)

## You can check in online @ carnival.com (you still have to have the above to board the ship)

   - Will need your booking number
   - Allows you to print out boarding passes, luggage tags, etc.
   - If checking in online, you will have to indicate whether you will be using a credit/debit card or cash for your Sign/Sail card to be associated with
       - You are given a card (like a credit card) to use for all purchases on the ship; this card is linked to the credit/debit card you provide (they do not use cash for anything on the ship)
   - If using cash, you will have to go to the main desk on the ship and give them the cash to link to the Sign/Sail card, once the cash has been depleted, you will have to go give them more cash

## You can purchase excursions and drink cards (Bubbles I think is for the unlimited soda and Cheers is for the unlimited alcohol AND soda) on line

   - You don’t have to purchase a drink card… you can pay as you go, using the Sign/Sail card and it will just go to the credit/debit card you have set up
       - Tea, coffee and water are at no extra charge

## Dining

   - We are supposed to be scheduled for the late seating (7 or 8, can’t remember).  However, you do NOT have to eat in the main dining area.  It’s a nice time to regroup with everyone however and plan the next day in case there are people doing the same things!
   - We should be at the same table with the same waiters each night
   - I think there are two (2) formal nights
       - You don’t have to dress in formal attire; however, most will wear at least a shirt/tie for men and nice dress or pant suit for ladies.  Some people go all out
   - Usually in the main dining area they prefer there not be any shorts and t-shirts.  Khakis for guys with nice shirts, sundresses or what have you for ladies

## The Ports are Nassau, Grand Turks and Half Moon Cay

   - Nassau – the ship will dock right up to the port
   - Nassau – if memory serves me right, there is a Straw Market there that for those not doing excursions can get off ship and walk around at.  Not sure what else there is to do at the port
   - Half Moon Cay – haven’t been, don’t know what to expect
   - Grand Turks – haven’t been, don’t know what to expect
   - You will want cash if purchasing off the ship.. I believe at Nassau anyway it’s like a Flea Market, they aren’t going to have the means of swiping a card

## Address to port in Baltimore MD is 2001 E Mccomas St.  Baltimore MD 21230

   - MapQuest says it’s about 3 ½ hour drive from Chester VA
       - Will want to allow for potty breaks and that wonderful northern VA traffic
       - Not sure of our boarding time yet

## Parking is either $15 per cruise night

   - I believe we pay when we leave
   - Might want to consider car pooling if possible and sharing the cost

## Cell phone plan/service

   - Check with your cell phone vendor/dealer to see about charges for texting or calling or being on the internet while on the cruise.  You don’t want to have your phone roaming and come back to a crazy bill ;)
   - Verizon rep said for mine, I can put it on airport mode which will keep any texts or calls from coming in, but I could still use the camera function.
